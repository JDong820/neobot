Neobot
======

Automated neopets income generation!

Currently the only thing that works is Freebies.harvest, but it works well and should be cross
platform!

I've scrapped any progress in Windows in favor of Linux development. I will work again on Windows using pywin32 when I have a few flash games in Linux working.


Have fun with this!
